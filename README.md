# TopoPrompt
The code implementation for the paper "TopoPrompt: A Topology-Adaptive Prompt Framework for Forecasting on Continuously Evolving Spatio-Temporal Graphs".

## Overview

TopoPrompt adapts to changing graph structures over time without retraining. It’s designed for scenarios where nodes or edges appear/disappear (e.g., traffic sensor networks), making it suitable for real-world streaming graph data.

# Datasets
The datasets used in our experiments include PEMS03-Stream, PEMS04-Stream, and Air-Stream, which are publicly available and can be obtained from other relevant repositories.
